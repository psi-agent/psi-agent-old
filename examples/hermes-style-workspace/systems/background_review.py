"""Background review — async post-turn learning for hermes-style-workspace.

After each user turn, ``BackgroundReview.maybe_spawn()`` checks two counters:
- memory review: fires every 10 user turns
- skill review: fires when the current turn had >= 10 tool calls
- combined: fires when both conditions are true simultaneously

Reviews run as isolated asyncio Tasks using a mini-ReAct loop driven by
``complete_fn``.  All exceptions are swallowed and logged at DEBUG level so
review failures never affect the main session.
