# Python Asyncio Fundamentals

## Core Rules
- Use `async def` / `await` for I/O-bound concurrency.
- Always `await` coroutines — unawaited coroutines are a bug.
- Never call blocking I/O inside an async function. Use `anyio.to_thread.run_sync()` or `asyncio.to_thread()` instead.

## Event Loop
- The event loop runs one coroutine at a time — cooperative multitasking.
- `await` is a yield point: it suspends the current coroutine and lets others run.
- CPU-heavy work blocks the loop. Offload to a thread or process.

## Common Patterns
```python
# Concurrent tasks
import asyncio
results = await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2(), task3())

# Timeout
await asyncio.wait_for(slow_operation(), timeout=5.0)

# Producer-consumer
queue = asyncio.Queue()
```

## Tools
- **anyio** — Trio-style structured concurrency, works with asyncio backend.
- **uvloop** — Drop-in faster event loop (not always needed).

## Traps
- `time.sleep()` blocks the event loop → use `await asyncio.sleep()`.
- `open()` blocks → use `aiofiles` or `anyio.open_file()`.
- Forget `await` → coroutine silently does nothing.
- Shared mutable state across tasks → use `asyncio.Lock`.
